# MD Bank
Self-hosted obsidian-style .md notes gallery.
## Purpose
The initial idea was to gain access to obsidian notes from any device. This way you can share your notes
with anybody or just have a little remote storage for yourself.
## TODO
- [ ] Backend file access safety
- [ ] Accessing files from a specific place on the server (not from the container itself)
- [ ] \*UI/UX improvements
